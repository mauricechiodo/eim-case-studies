**The case of Albert Speer**

As a young man, Albert Speer was deeply entranced by mathematics; in an anecdote from one of his later interviews, he recalled how in his final Abitur exams, he started revising three days before they started, only to complete the maths papers incredibly quickly and reattack each problem from two further perspectives – entirely for his own fun, he claimed. After studying architecture at university – his father claimed that he would never earn much as a mathematician – he became a quietly respectable professional for a few years.

After joining the Nazi Party in 1931, he rapidly rose through the ranks, at first principally acting as an architect for Hitler, designing the new grand monuments of Nazi Germany. Few were constructed, and fewer survive. His role changed substantially, however, in 1942, when he was appointed to Minister of Armaments and War Production. This put him in a position utterly integral to the German war effort; he enacted his duties with gusto, taking deep control over factories on an individual basis, and rendering the German industrial setup considerably more efficient. One of his major projects, for instance, ’Weingut I’, involved the pioneering construction of a nine-floor underground factory for the building of aircraft, in a manner impervious to air attacks by bombers. (It was, albeit, unfinished at the war’s close.)

He was not completely detached from the reality of the Reich, however. On several factory visits, in particular to the underground V2 rocket factory, he witnessed what he later realised was concentration camp labour. In the final days of the war, he was one of the only senior Nazis to seriously stand up to Hitler, refusing to implement his plan to destroy German infrastructure to slow the progress of the Allies; in this regard he was the first senior Nazi to recognise that the war was lost.

After the war, he became known as the ’Nazi who said sorry’ at the Nuremburg trials after, either cannily or genuinely, proclaiming his individual responsibility for the Nazi regime’s actions while simultaneously claiming he had never known about the horrors of the Holocaust. Perhaps he was telling the truth, perhaps not. We shall probably never know. But even if he had known – even if had been told exactly what was going on – what could he have done? It was entirely infeasible to leave the War Cabinet without putting himself in colossal personal danger, and he had insufficient authority to meaningfully stop the Holocaust by himself. It was much easier, and really the only feasible option, to construct his own reality, to constantly think that these horrible insinuations were never quite as bad as they seemed – in short, to keep doing the day job without asking too many questions.

After the war, he spent some twenty years in Spandau before being released, publishing several books about the inner workings of Nazi Germany, and generally being treated very well by the public. To what extent, however, was Speer using mathematics in his actions? There is little evidence that he was using any formal optimisation techniques to improve German performance, and the rapid improvement while Speer was in the role is rather down to the very low efficiency at the start which Speer brought to strong competence, rather than an act of real genius. Undoubtedly he was very good at his job, but it was probably not achieved via mathematical sophistication. It certainly could be said, however, that he brought a sort of mathematical culture to the organisation. (His predecessor in the role, Fritz Todt, was a construction engineer; his thesis had been on failures of road surfaces. Although his pre-war efforts to create the Autobahn system were largely suc- cessful, he began to falter during the war; some have suggested that his 1942 death in a plane crash was in fact an assassination, though this remains a fringe theory.)
