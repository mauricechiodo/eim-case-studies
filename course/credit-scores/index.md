Title: Credit Scoring

A credit score is a tool used by lenders to help determine whether or not you qualify for a particular credit card, loan, mortgage or service. They aren't just used by banks; increasingly they are being used by insurance firms, landlords and even employers are using it as a proxy to finding out how responsible you are. Consider the fact that they are now used by some employers. If you want money, and have a low credit score so can't get a loan, then you need to find a job. But, if you have a low credit score you can't find a job. This creates a feedback loop, and as a result people will be stuck, unable to progress in society.

Due to this it is pretty important that they are calculated as accurately as possible. But what is an accurate score? How do we verify this number and ensure it is reflecting the truth.

No single credit score exists, but there are 3 main credit reference agencies used in the UK: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion (formerly Callcredit).
