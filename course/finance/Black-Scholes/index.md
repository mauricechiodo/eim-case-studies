"*Since the turn of the century the greatest source of growth in the financial sector has been in financial instruments known as derivatives. Derivaties are not money, nor are they investments in stocks and shares. They are investments in investments, promises about promises. Derivatives traders use virtual money, numbers in a computer. They borrow it from investors who have probably borrowed in from somewhere else. Often they haven't borrowed it at all, not even virtually: they have clicked a mouse to agree that they *will* borrow the money if it ever becomes necessary. But they have no intention of letting it become necessary; they will sell the derivative before that happens. The lender - hypothetical lender, since the loan will never occur, for the same reason - probably doesn't actually have the money either. This is finance in cloud cuckoo land, yet it has become the standard practice of the world's banking system.*"

Arguably, one of the contributors to the financial crash was a mathematical equation: the Black-Scholes equation; a partial differential equation governing the price evolution of an option under the Black-Scholes model for financial markets.
