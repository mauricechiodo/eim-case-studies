## Austerity in the UK

The United Kingdom announced its austerity plan in its June 2010 budget report.$^1$ The paper detailed an economic plan that planned to eliminate the UK deficit$^{\text{F}1}$ by 2014/15 and have a surplus of 0.8% of the gdp by 2015/16.$^{1\text{, p.2}}$ However, in 2014/15 the deficit had been reduced to only £89.9 billion (4.8% of GDP) and in 2015/16 the deficit was still £75.5 billion (3.9% of GDP).$^{2\text{, p.8,Table 2}}$

The UK fiscal report makes reference to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which was founded in 2010/05/17$^{3\text{ Sect 1.1}}$ by the chancellor$^{\text{F}2}$ following the general election$^{\text{F}3}$ in order to act as an independent organisation that would inform financial decisions by forecasting the economy. The pre-budget report$^3$ details how they predict the economy will evolve with no change in fiscal policy.

The current macroeconomic model used by the obr is detailed on their website and is the same one that was used at the inception of the obr in 2010.$^4$ The model’s code (as of 2013/10) is dissected in ‘Briefing Paper No. 5’ (BP5)$^5$ the latest source code for the model is available on their website, written in Winsolve.$^{\text{F}4}$ $^6$ There is no explanation written mathematically for the code, so while reverse engineering the code into readable mathematical equations would be possible it would be extremely time-consuming.

In October 2013, the time of writing BP5, austerity had already started to be implemented and the deficit had seen a slight improvement, reducing to £99.9 billion, 5.6% of gdp.$^{2\text{, p.8, Table 2}}$

## In the Eurozone

According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a member state’s budget deficit may not exceed 3% of their GDP$^{10\text{, p.53-56, Article 126}}$
