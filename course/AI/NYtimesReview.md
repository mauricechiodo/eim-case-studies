# The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence

### A review on the article by the New York Times

This article claims that AI is "poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs." Whilst this is an important issue to consider, it suggests a naive view on the current state of AI. Rachel Thoms from *fast.ai* makes the point that the 'Human's vs. Machines' argument is not a very constructive framework to think of AI. She gives a particularly poignant example, "Most people working on medical applications of AI are not trying to replace doctors' they are trying to create tools that will allow doctors to be more accurate and more efficient, improving quality of care." It is important to note that algorithms are not void of human interaction, they require human input in gathering the data the machine learning algorithm requires to learn, deciding what decisions need to be made and how these decisions are used in the real world, and importantly we need humans to act as a mediator. We need to understand the limitation of the algorithms and know when and where AI can and should be used. AI is certainly not "poised" to take over, as the New York Times might suggest.
