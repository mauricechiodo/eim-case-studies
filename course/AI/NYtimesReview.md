# ["The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligence-economic-inequality.html)

### A review on the article by the New York Times

This article claims that AI is "poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs." Whilst this is an important issue to consider, it
suggests a naive view on the current state of AI. Rachel Thomas from [fast.ai](www.fast.ai) makes the point that the 'Human's vs. Machines'
argument is not a very constructive framework to think of AI. She gives a particularly poignant example, "Most people working on medical
applications of AI are not trying to replace doctors; they are trying to create tools that will allow doctors to be more accurate and more
efficient, improving quality of care." It is important to note that algorithms are not void of human interaction, they require human input
in gathering the data required to learn, deciding what decisions need to be made and how these decisions are
used in the real world, and importantly we need humans to act as a mediator. We need to understand the limitation of the algorithms and
know when and where AI can and should be used. AI will change the way the jobs and employment market looks and there are cetainly issues
that governments should consider within this (France has already thought about this a great deal - read ['For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence'](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/pdfs/MissionVillani_Report_ENG-VF.pdf) for more details). However, in its current state AI is
certainly not "poised" to take over, as the New York Times article might suggest.
