# Want less-biased decisions? Use algorithms.

### A review on the article by the Harvard Business Review

The article claims that "algorithms are less biased and more accurate than the humans they are replacing". This is a dangerous statement to make. Rachel Thomas of *fast.ai* has written about what HBR fails to mention in their article. She makes many important points. One such point is the issue that the people using the algorithms are unlikely to have very much understanding about how it works and therefore feel uncomfortable overriding a decision that an algorithm might make, even if the output seems strange. Additionally, algorithms are often used on a much larger scale than human decision-makers, so is likely to affect a much larger proportion of the population should any error occur, such as replicating an identical bias at scale. Another issue is that a lot of the algorithms that might be created for decision making are likely to be made by a private company, such as the sentencing algorithm COMPAS, and therefore the algorithm itself is proprietary software, and kept away from public scrutiny. This makes it difficult to appeal any result that the algorithm gives, because this would require the inner workings to be publicly known.
