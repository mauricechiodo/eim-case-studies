# ["Want Less-Biased Decisions? Use Algorithms."](https://hbr.org/2018/07/want-less-biased-decisions-use-algorithms)

### A review on the article by the Harvard Business Review

The article claims that "algorithms are less biased and more accurate than the humans they are replacing". This is a dangerous statement to
make. Rachel Thomas of [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) has [written about](http://www.fast.ai/2018/08/07/hbr-bias-algorithms/) what HBR fails to mention in their article. She makes many
important points, one such point being the issue that the people using the algorithms are unlikely to have very much understanding about how
they work, and therefore they may feel uncomfortable overriding a decision that an algorithm might make, even if the output seems strange.
Additionally, algorithms are often used on a much larger scale than human decision-makers, so is likely to affect a much larger proportion
of the population should any error occur, such as replicating an identical bias at scale. Another issue is that a lot of the algorithms
that might be created for decision making are likely to be made by a private company, such as the sentencing algorithm COMPAS, and
therefore the algorithm itself is proprietary software, and kept away from public scrutiny. This makes it difficult to appeal any result
that the algorithm gives, because this would require the inner workings to be publicly known.
